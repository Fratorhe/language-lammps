# Rule number (2) says that after a number sign the line is a comment

# Rule number (1) says that if the last printable character of a line &
  (i.e. not whitespaces) is an ampersand the next line is considered to be &
  part of the command. Even if we are in the comments!

# Rule number (5) says that every line is &
  broken into words separated by whitespaces

# Rule number (6) says that the first word in the line is the command and &
  the following are arguments. The package only highlights valid commands and &
  diferenciate between simulation commands and control commands

variable a equal 6

label checkpoint

# Rule number (3) says that the line is scanned for $ signs as reference for &
  variables. FIXME: talk about the math mode

print $a

# Rule number (7) says that you can use quotes to treat a bunch of words as a &
  single argument

print "I have $a fingers in every hand!"

# if a then "print 'by'" else "jump checkpoint" FIXME: end up this

# NOTE: There are lots of things that still are broken &
                      (or are ugly) &
            (specially if you use ampersands!) &
      (do not use ampersands, they make the code ugly) &
              but it works more or less now
